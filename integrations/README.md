<p>The <b>integrations</b> folder, while not being strictly necessary, is a way to aliviate the <b>configuration.yaml</b> file by specifying the configuration of each integration in a separate file.</p>

Some of the extensions that are configurated via .yaml (not via the interface) are:

- <a href="https://github.com/custom-components/authenticated" target="_blank">Authenticated</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/kuchel77/diskspace" target="_blank">Diskspace</a>
- <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/github/" target="_blank">Github</a>
- <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/spotify/" target="_blank">Spotify</a>
- <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/steam_online/" target="_blank">Steam</a>

<p>Notice that some integrations (officials and third-party ones) are strictly configured by the Lovelace interface; others can only be configurated via .yaml file and some (like Spotify for example), need to be configurated both via the Lovelace interface and via a .yaml file. Also, Home Assistant changes frequently and some integrations that were before configurated exclusively via .yaml are now Lovelace-configurable.</p>
